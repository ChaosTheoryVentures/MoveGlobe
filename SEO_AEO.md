## SEO and AEO Best Practices Summary

### What is SEO and AEO?
**SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** is the practice of helping your website rank higher on Google and other search engines. It focuses on:
- Writing helpful content
- Using the right keywords
- Structuring pages so search engines understand them

**AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)** is the evolution of SEO for the AI era. Instead of just ranking in search results, AEO helps your content become the actual answer to user questions in:
- Google's featured snippets
- Voice assistants like Siri and Alexa
- AI tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Claude
- Smart search systems on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube

### Why MoveGlobe Needs AEO
Future customers will ask AI and voice tools questions like:
- "What's the best AI consultancy in Netherlands?"
- "How much does AI business automation cost?"
- "How do I implement AI in my Dutch business?"

If MoveGlobe's site isn't the answer, competitors might be.

### How to Measure Results
Track impact using these tools:
- **Google Search Console** – Check if FAQ schema is detected & indexed
- **Bing Webmaster Tools** – Confirm IndexNow pings work
- **Perplexity / ChatGPT** – Ask questions and see if MoveGlobe is cited
- **AI visibility tools** like Goodie AI or Profound

Monitor:
- Featured snippet appearances
- Branded question results
- Organic and direct traffic increases
- AI tool citations and mentions

## The Bottom Line
- **SEO helps people find your page**
- **AEO helps AI agents speak your answer**

This plan balances traditional SEO fundamentals with cutting-edge AEO strategies to ensure MoveGlobe appears both in search results and as answers in AI tools.
